Templates are required to:

  * Not switch branches or perform operations across branches

  * Add and commit any changes it makes

Templates are executed in the same way as regular rails templates,
within the context of Rails::TemplateRunner, and may use any of the
instance methods available there.

To test your template before committing it, run

  autobahn --trace upgrade --uncommitted --no-merge
